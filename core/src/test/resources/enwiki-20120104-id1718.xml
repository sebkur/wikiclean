'''Ambrosiaster''' is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] epistles, &quot;brief in words but weighty in matter,&quot; and valuable for the criticism of the [[Latin]] text of the [[New Testament]]. This commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St [[Ambrose]].

The commentary itself was written during the papacy of [[Pope Damasus I]], that is, between 366 and 384, and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the [[Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]], and of the interpretation of Paul prior to [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

In 1527 [[Erasmus]] threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to Ambrose, and its author is now usually spoken of as Ambrosiaster, or pseudo-Ambrose.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kinzig  | first = Wolfram  | contribution = Ambrosiaster  | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] cites part of the commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] as by &quot;Sanctus Hilarius&quot; it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary. [[Germain Morin]] broke new ground by suggesting in 1899 that the writer was Isaac,&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. d'hist. et de litt. religieuses'', tom. iv. 97 f.&lt;/ref&gt; a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to [[Spain]] in 378-380 and then relapsed to [[Judaism]]; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of [[Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius]], proconsul of [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Africa]] in 377.

With this attribution [[Alexander Souter]] agrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Study of Ambrosiaster'' (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; There is scarcely anything to be said for the possibility of Ambrose having written the book before he became a bishop, and added to it in later years, incorporating remarks of [[Hilary of Poitiers]] on Romans. The best presentation of the case for Ambrose is by [[P. A. Ballerini]] in his complete edition of that father's works. 

Several other minor works have been attributed to this same author. There is also the ''Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti,'' which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. Most scholars consider this work to be that of Pseudo-Ambrose as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;
