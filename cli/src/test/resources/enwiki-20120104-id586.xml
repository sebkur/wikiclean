The '''American Standard Code for Information Interchange''' ('''ASCII''', {{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|æ|s|k|i}} {{respell|ASS|kee}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?ascii001.wav=ASCII Audio pronunciation for ASCII]. ''Merriam Webster''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[character encoding|character-encoding scheme]] based on the [[Order (mathematics)|ordering]] of the [[English alphabet]]. ASCII codes represent [[character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s, [[telecommunication|communications]] equipment, and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many more characters than ASCII does.

'''US-ASCII''' is the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) preferred charset name for ASCII.

Historically, ASCII developed from [[Telegraph code|telegraphic codes]]. Its first commercial use was as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services. Work on ASCII formally began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published during 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;&gt;Mary Brandel (July 6, 1999).

ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing [[control character]]s (now mostly obsolete)&lt;ref name=&quot;Maini2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Maini | first = Anil Kumar | title = Digital Electronics: Principles, Devices and Applications | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 2007 | page = 28  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhMBR_slRzIC&amp;pg=PA28 | isbn = 9780470032145  | quote = In addition, it defines codes for 33 nonprinting, mostly obsolete control characters that affect how the text is processed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that affect how text and space is processed;&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization (December 1, 1975). &quot;[http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/001.pdf The set of control characters for ISO 646]&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:ASCII Code Chart-Quick ref card.png|thumb|361px|The US ASCII 1968 Code Chart was structured with two columns of control characters, a column with special characters, a column with numbers, and four columns of letters]]
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group. The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.
To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

The committee debated the possibility of a [[shift key]] function (like the [[Baudot code]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six [[bit]]s. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.
It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]]; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 4. Mackenzie, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 5. Mackenzie, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer A. Sawyer and Steven George Krantz (January 1, 1995). ''A Tex Primer for Scientists''. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-7159-7. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 8,9. Mackenzie, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Decision 10. Mackenzie, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 14. Mackenzie, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter &quot;A&quot; was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 18. Mackenzie, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters. Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses. The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; next to the letter A.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.66, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.435.&lt;/ref&gt; The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,&lt;ref&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|brace]] and vertical line characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).

The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([[least significant bit]] first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.

ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit Baudot code, which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;/&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bemer (n.d.). [http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM Bemer meets Europe]. ''Trailing-edge.com''. Accessed 2008-04-14. Employed at [[IBM]] at that time&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called &quot;the father of ASCII.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;

&lt;!-- &quot;The endorsement of the Federal government, then the largest purchaser of computer equipment, was probably the single most important reason for the subsequent wide adoption of ASCII.&quot; – Martha M. Gray [http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf]. /* ?? */ --&gt;
On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. ''The American Presidency Project''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is  defined strictly only by ANSI standard.

ASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ASCII, a significant advantage.

==ASCII control characters==
{{main|Control character}}

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2822 (April 2001). &quot;NO-WS-CTL&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional (where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]]) and sometimes accidental (such as what &quot;delete&quot; means).

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] [[ASR-33 Teletype|Model 33 ASR]] series, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage through the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 [[Delete key|(Delete)]] became de facto standards. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off) as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.

Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;. Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. Tapes designed to be &quot;hand edited&quot; could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; and then replacements put into the empty space.

As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the &quot;rubout&quot; character was lost. DEC systems, for example, interpreted &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character before the cursor&quot; and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used &quot;Backspace&quot; for that meaning and used &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character at the cursor&quot;. That latter interpretation is the most common now.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C programming language|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;Control Sequence Introducer&quot;) beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; and &quot;Linefeed&quot;. The first returns the printing carriage to the beginning of the line and the second advances to the next line without moving the carriage. However, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduced unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters, [[plain text]] files on [[Unix-like|Unix]] and [[Amiga]] systems use line feeds alone to separate lines. Similarly, older Macintosh systems, among others, use only carriage returns in plain text files. Various [[IBM]] operating systems used both characters to mark the end of a line, perhaps for compatibility with [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]].
This de facto standard was copied into [[CP/M]] and then into [[MS-DOS]] and eventually into [[Microsoft Windows]]. Transmission of text over the [[Internet]], for protocols as [[E-mail]] and the [[World Wide Web]], uses both characters.

Some operating systems such as the pre-[[OpenVMS|VMS]] [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.  For this reason, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] (TLA) for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]], was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]].  ASCII [[string (computer science)|string]]s ending with the [[null character]] are known as ASCIZ, ASCIIZ or [[null-terminated string]]s.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;^H&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{keypress|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASCII printable characters==
Codes 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to 7E&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.

Code 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie 223&quot;&gt;Mackenzie, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus would not normally be visible, it is represented here by [[Unicode]] character U+2420 &quot;␠&quot;; [[Unicode]] characters U+2422 &quot;␢&quot; and U+2423 &quot;␣&quot; are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary.

Code 7F&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the non-printable &quot;Delete&quot; (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.

Earlier versions of ASCII used the up-arrow instead of the [[caret]] (5E&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Aliases==
A June 1992 RFC&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1345 (June 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] registry of character sets&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot; /&gt; recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* iso-ir-6
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* ASCII (with ASCII-7 and ASCII-8 variants)
* ISO646-US
* US-ASCII (preferred [[MIME]] name)&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot;&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (May 14, 2007). &quot;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]&quot;. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* us
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII
&lt;/div&gt;

Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name &quot;US-ASCII&quot; for [[Internet]] uses of ASCII. One often finds this in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.

The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.

===Incompatibility vs interoperability===
From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria,&quot; attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15,&quot; September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally-useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use.&quot;  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref&gt;R. Maréchal, ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as
:&lt;code&gt;ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü&lt;/code&gt;
instead of
:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i]='\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;
[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.

Eventually, as 8-, 16-, and [[32-bit]] computers began to replace 18- and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII, with the 128 additional characters providing room to avoid most of the ambiguity that had been necessary in 7-bit codes.

For example, [[IBM]] developed 8-bit [[code page]]s, such as [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware.  [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]].

Eight-bit standards such as [[ISO/IEC 8859]] (derived from the DEC-MCS) and [[Mac OS Roman]] developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters. This enabled representation of characters used in a broader range of languages. Because there were several competing 8-bit code standards, they continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations. Still, [[ISO-8859-1]] (Latin 1), its variant [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), and the original 7-bit ASCII remain the most common character encodings in use today.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).

To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and, conversely, the UTF-8 encoding forms are binary-compatible with ASCII for code points below 128, meaning all ASCII is valid UTF-8. The other encoding forms resemble ASCII in how they represent the first 128 characters of Unicode, but use 16 or 32 bits per character, so they require conversion for compatibility. (similarly [[UCS-2]] is upwards compatible with UTF-16)

==Order==
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp ASCIIbetical definition]. ''[[PC Magazine]]''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:
* All uppercase come before lowercase letters, for example, &quot;Z&quot; before &quot;a&quot;
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters, for example, &quot;4&quot; is before &quot;one&quot;
An intermediate order that can be easily implemented converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.
